    <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
    <h2>WEEK â€“ 3 (From Dt 29/5/24 to Dt 4/6/24)</h2>

    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Knowing about the people of that area.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p>As we decided to know about the people of the area, we resumed our work i.e., roaming around their houses, and to know about the people better. We had decided to ask them about the importance of trees.</p>
    <p>As we had known them for the past two weeks, we strongly believe that they will definitely believe us. In the same belief, we started moving to the next step of the process this week. We started doing the same as the previous weeks to get the entire knowledge about the area and also the people.</p>
    <p>I think we had planned very well because without these minute details about the people and the area, we cannot proceed with the further developments of the project. We did not feel it as a burden because we had enjoyed doing especially this project because for myself, I am very much interested in knowing about the trees.</p>
    <p>So, on the last days of this week, we had visited one special house in that lane. The reason behind calling the house special is because in that house there was an old woman who had better knowledge about various plants and also their uses. We had gained very much knowledge about the trees which will be useful to us in further steps of our project.</p>
