    <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
    <h2>WEEK – 5 (From Dt 12/06/24 to Dt 19/06/24)</h2>

    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Giving awareness to the people about trees.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p>As we decided to plant awareness of trees in people’s minds in that area, we arrived at the houses of our project area afresh. So, this time we arrived at their houses to give the awareness to them.</p>
    <p>Rather than going around house to house individually, we had decided to gather the people around our area in order to make them aware about the importance of trees. As we planned to give the awareness program to the people, we had done some arrangements which include small charts which will help us to demonstrate them in an effective way. We had taken the help of the internet in doing this because we thought that we can give more knowledge with this.</p>
    <p>I think we had given a brief presentation about the importance of trees to the people with the help of the internet. Also, they had responded in a very positive way like they too showed interest in this project of ours.</p>
    <p>So finally, we started the ultimate step of our project as we planned which is of course a part of the project i.e., distribution of the plants to those who are in need of them in the project area. They really felt elated while we had distributed the plants. Along with our batchmates, I feel very satisfied while doing this step in the project.</p>
