    <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
    <h2>WEEK – 4 (From Dt 5/06/24 to Dt 12/06/24)</h2>

    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Giving awareness to future generation.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p>We started this week by going to a school in the premises of our area with the permission of the headmaster of that school. The students were a bit excited when we entered there. When they found the reason behind our arrival, we were asked a many number of questions about our project topic by them. Initially, we decided to get more acquaintance with them, so, we had spent the first two days by just interacting with them.</p>
    <p>It also helps us to do our works in a very simple way after that contact made with them. As we got acquainted with the students of the school, we planned to start the same procedure as we did in the last week of the project. So, for this, we planned some arrangements for further proceedings.</p>
    <p>Our batch arranged to ask them the same questions that we asked the people in the area and also the queries facing by them. As expected, the students gave us a really enjoying company in this program. By watching the interest in the students, we had planned a small joyful task for them. In this task, we had observed their complete efforts and noted them.</p>
    <p>The last phase in this week is to make them aware about the importance of trees. The students had acquired the knowledge about the trees. The task is to make the students responsible about their surroundings i.e., we had asked them to observe the surroundings.</p>
    <p>We did all we can do to ensure our project’s success but with the principal’s request we couldn’t able to click many photos.</p>
