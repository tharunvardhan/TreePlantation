    <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
    <h2>WEEK â€“ 6 (From Dt 19/06/24 to Dt 25/06/24)</h2>

    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Distribution of plants</p>

    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p>We started to do the same procedure as the previous week but in a school this time, because we thought that we should also put the same sense of the importance of trees in the upcoming generation too. As they are the foundation to the future of our country, we decided to let them know about the importance of trees.</p>
    <p>So, we arrived at a school in the premises of our project area with the permission of the headmaster of that school. The students were a bit excited when we entered there. When they found the reason behind our arrival, we were asked many questions about our project topic by them. Initially, we decided to get more acquaintance with them, so, we had spent the first two days just interacting with them. It also helped us to do our work in a very simple way after that contact was made with them.</p>
    <p>We prepared the arrangements for our presentation of the awareness program. We got great support not only from all teachers and the headmaster but also from the children of that school during our presentation about our topic in the community service project. All of them listened to our presentation very carefully. After the end of our presentation, all of them applauded us and the staff who were working there praised us for the selection of the topic. We really felt very contented after finishing our presentation before all the people of the school.</p>
    <p>So, moving on to the next phase of the conclusion, as we all know, children are a bit enthusiastic and here was the same situation. We used that zeal by giving a very casual task which would also be helpful to them. The task was to learn and present like us in front of their friends about the same topic and also they should inform other people about that day. In both tasks, they showed their best efforts. Finally, we gave plants to the students as well as teachers which ended our project.</p>
