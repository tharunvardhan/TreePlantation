    <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
    <h2>WEEK â€“ 1 (From Dt 16/5/24 to Dt 21/05/24)</h2>

    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Noticing the surroundings of our project area.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p>As we started the project, we came to know about the lack of trees. We started checking and monitoring the areas around that area. The people in the area were enquired by us about the geography and also, the effects facing by them which thereby caused by the lack of trees.</p>
    <p>Firstly, we started slowly communicating with the people of that area about their needs and the difficulties facing by them. Then, we came to know that their major problems were due to the lack of trees around the places living by the people.</p>
    <p>Secondly, we started approaching the houses of the people individually so that we can analyze the area more clearly which will help us to do our project exceptionally.</p>
    <p>At the end of the first week of our project, we decided to roam around the houses in that area every lane wise so that we can interact with that people efficiently. It will help us to end our project in a better way. So, in this way we concluded our first week of the project.</p>
