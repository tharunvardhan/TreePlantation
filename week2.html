    <h1>Weekly Report</h1>
    <h2>WEEK – 2 (From Dt 22/5/24 to Dt 29/5/24)</h2>

    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Acquired partial knowledge about our project area.</p>

    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p>We started our second week of the project by going around the houses for detailed information about our area of interest. As we commenced our deeds in order to acquire knowledge about the problems around that area, we came to know that there are many problems in that area which are related to the lack of trees.</p>
    <p>So, we started approaching more houses in the area to get better knowledge. As we started approaching their houses, we observed that the people in that area had welcomed us with their pure hearts.</p>
    <p>When we started asking about the problems they are facing in that area, they began telling us their very problems. By watching us noting down the problems which they told us, some even requested us to solve their problems as soon as possible. So, this is one of the best examples of the purity of the people around the area.</p>
    <p>As we scheduled our second week of the community service project to go around the houses in that area and to get knowledge about the circumstances of both the people and the surroundings, we had almost completed our tasks that were assigned as per the team’s decision. Having known that there is no proper knowledge among the people about trees, we had chosen to implement an awareness program to improve their consciousness about the importance of trees around our surroundings. Finally, we had finished our second week of the project.</p>
